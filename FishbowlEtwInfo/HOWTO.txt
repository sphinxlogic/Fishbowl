The ETW class is autogenerated from the manifest.
To update the manifest:
* Use the SDK tool "Manifest Generator" (ecmangen.exe)
* Open the .man file to add and edit events.

To generate/update the .cs file:
*  Run the updatelogger.cmd script.  It has a hardcoded path that may not be valid.  It does require the Windows SDK be installed.
** e.g. (c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0\Bin\mc.exe" -css Standard Fishbowl.man)
* Replace the checked in version of Fishbowl.cs.  Check that any updates still build.
* The generated cs file can be referenced from code.

NB:
